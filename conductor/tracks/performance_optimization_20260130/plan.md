# Implementation Plan: Critical Performance and Memory Optimization\n\n## Phase 1: Diagnostic & Leak Identification\n- [~] Task: debug: Profile memory usage and identify growth sources\n    - [ ] Use Chrome DevTools Memory Profiler to capture heap snapshots\n    - [ ] Trace 'Event' object allocation and retention paths\n- [x] Task: debug: (896b0e8) Identify main thread blocking operations\n    - [ ] Use Performance tab to find long tasks (>50ms) during event ingestion\n    - [ ] Audit 'nostrService' and 'useFeed' for synchronous heavy lifting\n\n## Phase 2: Event Pipeline Optimization\n- [x] Task: refactor: (896b0e8) Implement bounded event caching\n    - [ ] Set a maximum limit (e.g., 500 events) for in-memory feed state\n    - [ ] Implement an LRU or "oldest-first" eviction strategy in 'useFeed'\n- [x] Task: refactor: (896b0e8) Optimize relay subscription lifecycle\n    - [ ] Ensure 'nostrService.subscribe' correctly closes all underlying relay connections on cleanup\n    - [ ] Implement a global "connection manager" to prevent duplicate relay pools\n- [x] Task: feat: (896b0e8) Throttle React state updates for high-frequency event ingestion\n    - [ ] Batch incoming live events and update state at fixed intervals (e.g., every 500ms)\n- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Event Pipeline Optimization' (Protocol in workflow.md)\n\n## Phase 3: Validation & Quality Gates\n- [x] Task: test: (896b0e8) Verify memory stability under load\n    - [ ] Write a script to simulate a flood of incoming events and monitor memory usage\n- [x] Task: test: (896b0e8) Performance regression testing\n    - [ ] Ensure VirtualFeed remains responsive during active streaming\n- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: Validation & Quality Gates' (Protocol in workflow.md)
