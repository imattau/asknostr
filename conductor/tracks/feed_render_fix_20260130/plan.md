# Implementation Plan: Fix VirtualFeed Rendering Glitches\n\n## Phase 1: Dynamic Height Management\n- [~] Task: refactor: Enhance 'VirtualFeed' to support dynamic row re-measurement\n    - [ ] Write failing test to simulate content height change after initial render\n    - [ ] Implement 'VariableSizeList' (or equivalent) with a 'resetAfterIndex' trigger\n- [ ] Task: feat: Implement loading callbacks in 'Post' and 'TorrentMedia' components\n    - [ ] Write tests for image/video load completion signals\n    - [ ] Add 'onHeightChange' callback props to components containing async media\n- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Dynamic Height Management' (Protocol in workflow.md)\n\n## Phase 2: Append Stability\n- [ ] Task: fix: Resolve 'Load More' overlapping issues\n    - [ ] Write test case for appending batches of events to the virtual list\n    - [ ] Ensure list cache is cleared or updated correctly when the 'events' array length changes\n- [ ] Task: fix: Stabilize row keys and indexing\n    - [ ] Audit 'itemKey' generation to ensure absolute uniqueness across appends\n    - [ ] Fix any index-based rendering collisions\n- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Append Stability' (Protocol in workflow.md)
