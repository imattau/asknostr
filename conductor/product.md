# Initial Concept\nAn existing project named 'asknostr', a decentralized social application built on the Nostr protocol.
# Product Guide: asknostr\n\n## Target Users\n- **Nostr Power Users:** Individuals seeking a robust, decentralized community experience with advanced moderation and discovery tools.\n- **Privacy-Conscious Communities:** Groups looking to migrate from centralized platforms (like Reddit or Discord) to a censorship-resistant environment.\n- **Technical Enthusiasts:** Users interested in the intersection of decentralized social protocols (Nostr) and peer-to-peer storage (BitTorrent).\n\n## Goals\n- **Decentralized Community Management:** Provide a seamless experience for creating, discovering, and moderating communities on Nostr (using established and emerging NIPs).\n- **High Performance:** Deliver a fast, responsive UI using virtualization and optimized relay communication.\n- **Protocol Integration:** Leverage Nostr for social interaction and BitTorrent for decentralized media storage and sharing.
- **Background Seeding:** Maintain decentralized media availability even when the UI is not active.
- **Censorship Resistance:** Ensure that community data and moderation logs are transparent and resistant to single-point failure.\n\n## Key Features\n- **Community Feeds:** Real-time feeds for specific communities with support for threaded discussions.\n- **Moderation Suite:** Comprehensive tools for community owners to manage content, including mod queues and public moderation logs.\n- **Global Discovery:** Hooks and UI components for trending tags, communities, and user suggestions.\n- **BitTorrent Media Storage:** Integrated service for uploading and streaming media via the BitTorrent protocol.\n- **NIP-05 Support:** Built-in identity verification for users.\n- **Multi-Layout Support:** Optimized views for both classic desktop (ClassicLayout) and mobile swipe-based (SwipeLayout) experiences.\n- **Zaps & Reactions:** Full support for Nostr's lightning-based tipping (Zaps) and expressive reactions.\n\n## Vision\nTo become the premier open-source client for decentralized communities, empowering users to own their digital spaces without relying on centralized intermediaries.
