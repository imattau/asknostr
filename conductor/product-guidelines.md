# Product Guidelines: asknostr\n\n## Visual Identity & UX\n- **Modern Minimalism:** Prioritize a clean, high-contrast interface using a palette centered on Slate colors. Support multiple themes including 'Modern', 'Terminal', and 'Light'.\n- **Responsive Fluidity:** Utilize Framer Motion for purposeful transitions and tactile feedback. The application must feel snappy and responsive across both desktop (ClassicLayout) and mobile (SwipeLayout).\n- **Tactile Interaction:** Incorporate haptics for critical actions on mobile to reinforce user interactions.\n\n## Tone & Messaging\n- **Technical yet Accessible:** Communicate clearly about decentralized concepts without overwhelming the user with jargon.\n- **Empowering & Transparent:** Emphasize user ownership of data and the transparency of moderation actions through public logs.\n- **Community-Centric:** Use language that fosters a sense of belonging and collaborative management.\n\n## Design Principles\n- **Performance First:** Use virtualization (react-window) and optimized data fetching (TanStack Query) to ensure smooth scrolling and rapid loading even with large datasets.\n- **Protocol-Native:** Design interactions that respect and leverage the unique properties of the Nostr protocol (e.g., event-based updates, decentralized identity).\n- **Accessibility:** Ensure high contrast ratios and keyboard navigability are maintained across all themes and layouts.
